= GodModeGizmos

These are buttons that show up on selected storage buildings when having god mode enabled.

The Add stack button adds a stack of the first allowed item from the storage filter. Right clicking it opens a float
menu with the full list of available options for the building.

Edit graphics opens a window to edit the current GraphicsDef with. It's meant for tweaking of offsets and similar.

Update graphics applies the changes made with Edit graphics. Most don't apply automatically.
