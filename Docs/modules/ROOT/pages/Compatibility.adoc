= Compatibility

Yes, everything including CE and LWM's Deep Storage is compatible. Offsets for certain graphics can sometimes look
wrong. Such offsets can be solved on custom Graphic subclasses by implementing `+ITransformable<Thing>+` there. Custom
offsets, labels, icons and similar for overlays like those from Recycle This aren't supported yet. Those just get
displayed the vanilla way.

If something isn't compatible at all, contact me on discord and we'll work it out.
