= ContentLabelWorker

The C# class providing the implementation for a `ContentLabelStyleDef`. Default implementations supplied by the
framework can be viewed at
https://github.com/bbradson/Adaptive-Storage-Framework/blob/main/Source/AdaptiveStorage/ContentLabelWorker.cs.

`+UpdateLabels+` runs whenever thing counts change and should return the labels to display or null in case of no labels.

`+DrawGUIOverlayLabels+` runs every frame and draws the previously prepared labels.

`+ResolveReferences+` can be used to initialize `ContentLabelStyleDef` specific data. Each `ContentLabelStyleDef` gets
its own worker instance initialized.
