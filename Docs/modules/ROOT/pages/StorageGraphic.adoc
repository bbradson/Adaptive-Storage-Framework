= StorageGraphic

These are set within ``GraphicDef``s, defining how to display the storage building. Buildings always only ever display
one `StorageGraphic`, with the framework selecting the graphic with the highest valid `minimumStackCount` value within
the currently active `GraphicsDef` by default. Each `StorageGraphic` can then have multiple `GraphicData` nodes,
declared through `+<graphicData>+` or `+<graphicDatas>+`. These act mostly like the vanilla `GraphicData`, accept
`graphicClass` values, `shaderType`, `texPath`, `drawOffset`, and everything else they have too. Additionally they take
the values described in xref:StorageGraphicData.adoc[StorageGraphicData].
