= ITransformable

Things can implement `ITransformable.ITransformable` from the `1ITransformable.dll` assembly to supply adaptive storage
compatible custom rendering with support for scaling, rotation and offsets, taking in a TransformData struct.

Graphics can implement `ITransformable.ITransformable<Thing>` with the same purpose.
