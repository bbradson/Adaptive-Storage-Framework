Adaptive Storage Framework contains various features to allow modders to better shape the way they want to make and change their own storage mods. It has added functionalities to change graphics depending on contents, tweak how items get displayed, how many graphics get displayed, how they get colored, how to display text and so on. A couple other features like more fine grained storage capacity control and temperature controls are included too.

Visible to users, the framework itself always adds a contents tab, a group tab for buildings in a storage group and enhances selection behaviour for storage buildings. A collection containing mods using this framework is available [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3381351248). Let us know if you believe another mod to belong there.  
  
You can also include this banner in your mod page to signify that your mod requires ASF to work.

Q: Where can I read about these functionalities? How can I use them for my mod?  
A: Documentation can be found here: https://github.com/bbradson/Adaptive-Storage-Framework/blob/main/Docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc  
  
Q: Is this compatible with LWM Deep Storage?  
A: Yes! LWM is compatible and will not interfere with any of our features, in fact, the two compliment each other. Additionally, there are mod settings in ASF for you to choose between some systems.  
  
Q: Is this compatible with [insert storage mod here]?  
A: ASF only adds extra functionalities to be used. It doesn’t alter already existing features by itself, especially not making any changes to haul AI or similar. It should be compatible with most mods out there.  
  
Q: How do I tweak storage stats?  
A: Unlike deep storage, this doesn't have a custom made settings menu only for buildings made with the mod. It is instead compatible with [RIMMSqol](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1084452457) however. Every storage building can have the majority of its stats freely adjusted there.  
Quick edits for modding purposes can additionally be made with the edit graphics button that shows up on buildings when having god mode active. These god mode changes don't get saved though.  
  
Q: How performance friendly is this mod?  
A: Very. We made sure to make the framework as performance friendly as possible so it shouldn’t affect your gameplay. The result of the framework's custom rendering and various caches should even be improved performance over using plain vanilla shelves without any additional mods.
More details on optimizations this includes over vanilla shelves are described here: https://github.com/bbradson/Adaptive-Storage-Framework/blob/main/Docs/modules/ROOT/pages/Performance.adoc  
  
Q: Do you accept suggestions?  
A: Yes! If you have a well thought out idea, please comment it down below and let us know what you think the mod is missing.

Hard incompatibilities:  
- Stockpile Stack Limit (Continued) has been reported to break the vanilla multiple items per cell functionality, which this relies on  
  
Soft Incompatibilities:  
- Designators from mods like Recycle This may appear inside containers with wrong offsets and no direct UI support
